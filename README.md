# Featurization-Model-Tuning

Concrete is the most important material in civil engineering. 
The concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age and ingredients. 
These ingredients include cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, 
coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate.
A multiple regressionmodel is created to determine the mixture of each component to determine the final 
composition by featurre engineering and hyperparameter tuning.
The composition is regressed with 95% confidence.
